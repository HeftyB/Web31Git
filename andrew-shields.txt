    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

    the box model puts all the html elements into "boxes" layed out the page depending on markup. Each box has it's content in the middle surrounding by an area of padding, which is surrounded by a boarder, which itself is surrounded by a margin area. Using the elements of the box model you are able to layout boxes for design. The fix for the box model would be proper sizing of boxes using measurments that allow for responsive design.
